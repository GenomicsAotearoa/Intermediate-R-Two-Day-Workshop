In this workshop you will begin to learn intermediate level skills in the R programming language. There are many skills and tools that could be defined as "intermediate level", and here we will work with just a small number. This workshop will be taught over two mornings from 9am - 1pm. 



**Day 1**

- String manipulation

- Managing and manipulating relational data

**Day 2**

- Writing functions

- Using iterations

## Prerequisites 

To fully engage with the material in this workshop, you will need:

**An [Introductory level of R](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Introduction-to-R/) including:**

- Variable assignment

- Mathematical and Boolean operators

- Data modes

- Importing data

**Some familiarity with the tidyverse dialect of R, as shown [here](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Introduction-to-R/appendix/05-dplyr/):**

- mutate() and filter()
